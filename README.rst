#### Cspark-python is a [cisco spark](https://www.ciscospark.com/) bot library


1. Install it with PIP:
```
pip install cspark-python
```

2. Then go to developer website, [create new bot](https://developer.ciscospark.com/apps.html) and achieve **Access Token**.

> If you stacked with icon uploading mechanism (as I always do), you can use random photo of a cat: https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/562466745340817408/_nIu8KHX.jpeg 

3. Use that code to start your first bot. Don't forget to change **Access Token**.

```

```

4. Follow "example" folder to become bot guru.

P.S. Cisco Spark team use term "SDK" for libraries which use their API... Ok. As you wish. That's **Cisco Spark Python SDK**.
